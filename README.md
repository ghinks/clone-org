# Clone GitHub namespace

## Clone an organization's repos.

Clone an organization's repos. A common situation that folks find themselves
in when starting to work with an organization is the ability to check out all
the code and essentially familiarize themselves with the code base and even
grep the code base looking for things. clone-org is designed to lessen
the pain and give you a one-stop clone the organization toolkit. This module
queries the GitHub graphql endpoint.

Clone-org uses the installed version of git on your machine and executes shell
commands.

Currently, clone-org only supports GitHub and other cloud providers will be
tested in the future.

#### For https remotes
You must have 'GITHUB_TOKEN' defined in your environment for the organization
to be queried. The clone may be optionally either https or ssh

#### For ssh remotes
You must have your ssh keys set up in current shell.

## Installing
```shell
    $ pip install clone-org
```

### A Simple Example
```shell
    $ clone-org -o kubernetes-client -p https -f ~/dev/kub-client-repos
```

## Help

    $ clone-org -h
```

```shell
usage: clone-org [-h] [-o ORGANIZATION] [-l LANGUAGES] [-p {https,ssh}]
                 [-f FOLDER] [-c] [-d] [-v]

  -l LANGUAGES, --languages LANGUAGES
                        Github classes languages with well known names such as
                        Python, Go, shell etc. You may pass a filter -l python
                        and it will compare it to the given primary language
                        assigned to the repo. Comma separated strings such as
                        python,java,javascript are also accepted. Names are
                        defined by github in the github/linguist repo.
  -p {https,ssh}, --protocol {https,ssh}
                        The protocol to use either https , which will require
                        GITHUB_TOKEN to be defined in your environment
                        variables. Or ssh which will require that you have
                        your ssh keys set up in current shell.
  -f FOLDER, --folder FOLDER
                        The target folder should be a fully qualified name and
                        the directory structures tested are OSx and Linux. An
                        example would be -f /home/Users/alice/dev/
  -c, --create          To create the target folder set this flag and the
                        directory structure will be created if possible An
                        example would be clone-org -o your_org_name -p https
                        -f ~/temp/my_repos -c
  -d, --dry-run         The user may simply wish to query the organization
                        before cloning. The dry run option will print out the
                        repositories in the organization specified and exit.
  -v, --version         Print version and exit
